# Plugin Development Guide
A <i>plugin</i>, short for "plug-in" or "add-on", is a piece of software that adds a specific functionality or feature to an existing application or system. 
Plugins are typically designed to extend the functionality of an existing program, without requiring the user to modify or recompile the original application code.

This plugin development guide aims to help algorithm developers to build their own
algorithm(s) plugin that adds a new algorithm or capability to the A.I. Verify.

!!! note
    Before developing your own plugin, it is best to visit our [existing plugins](samples/partial-dependence-plot.md) to check if it is already available for use.

----------------------------------------------------
In this section, we are covering topics to be proficient in developing algorithm plugins:

- [Create your first algorithm plugin](first-algorithm-plugin.md) <br>
  This subsection will help developers follow through the creation phase and develop their first algorithm plugin 
  which reads in a string input and returns the input string.
<br>
<br>
- [In-depth reference](algorithm-plugin-in-depth-reference.md) <br>
  This subsection will help developers read in more details about the generated 
  files and knowing how the whole algorithm plugin work.
<br>
<br>
- [Advanced Topics](algorithm-plugin-advanced-topics.md) <br>
  This subsection will discuss on advanced topics that developers might need 
  while developing your own algorithm plugins.
<br>
<br>
- [Samples](samples/partial-dependence-plot.md) <br>
  This subsection will provide samples for developers to reference.
