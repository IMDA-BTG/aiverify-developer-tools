# AI Verify Developer Documentation

[**AI Verify**](https://github.com/IMDA-BTG/aiverify) is built with **extensibility** and **open source collaboration** in mind. Adopting a modular software design approach, it is powered by a [**plugin system**](./guided_example/introduction_to_plugins.md), where features ranging from report templates to testing algorithms can be customised and enhanced through an AI Verify plugin. In the spirit of open source, AI Verify welcomes developers and interested parties to collaborate together and get started [here](./getting_started/start_here.md).
